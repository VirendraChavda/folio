By analyzing the relationships between accounts and identifying central nodes, the project uncovers suspicious patterns in transaction flows. Key measures such as degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality are used to highlight accounts that play crucial roles in facilitating potentially illicit transactions. Additionally, community detection algorithms like the Girvan-Newman method are employed to isolate clusters of related accounts for deeper investigation. Through this approach, the project provides insights into how network analysis can enhance anti-money laundering efforts by identifying high-risk accounts within complex transaction networks." },

The analysis identifies optimal price points with confidence intervals, providing actionable insights into conservative and optimistic pricing strategies. This approach enables precise, revenue-maximizing pricing decisions tailored to each product, highlighting the potential of statistical modeling in dynamic pricing optimization." },

Key statistical tests, including the Chi-Square Test, Point-Biserial Correlation, and Linear Regression, reveal significant differences in conversion rates and a moderate positive link between ad frequency and conversions. However, effect size (Cohenâ€™s d) shows a modest practical impact, suggesting that while increased ad exposure boosts conversions, the effect is limited. These insights guide future campaign optimization to balance ad frequency and conversion potential effectively." }

By applying dimensionality reduction techniques such as two-sample t-tests, LASSO regression, and variance-based selection, the study tackles high-dimensional biological data. Supervised models like KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression were validated through K-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping, showing significant accuracy improvements, with KNN and SVM achieving near-perfect results. Unsupervised methods like clustering and PCA were also explored to uncover underlying data patterns, offering valuable insights for cancer classification." },
